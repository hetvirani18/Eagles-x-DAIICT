- ✅ Smoother user interactions
- ✅ Better performance during heavy operations

### 2. **`startTransition` API**
```javascript
// Non-blocking state updates
startTransition(() => {
  setSearchLocation(location);
  setSuggestions(cities);
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Keeps UI responsive during updates
- ✅ Prioritizes user interactions
- ✅ Better perceived performance

### 3. **Enhanced Error Boundaries**
```javascript
class React19ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Modern error handling with better UX
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Graceful error recovery
- ✅ Better error reporting
- ✅ Improved debugging experience

### 4. **Suspense Integration**
```javascript
<Suspense fallback={<React19LoadingFallback />}>
  {useReact19Features ? (
    <SearchComponentReact19 />
  ) : (
    <SearchComponent />
  )}
</Suspense>
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better loading states
- ✅ Smoother component transitions
- ✅ Enhanced user experience
